# New System Introduction: Freedom from Discord Dependency 😎

Since the shutdown of Discord in Turkey, FiveM roleplay servers have faced significant issues. Servers have relied on Discord for communication, donations, complaint management, and server logs. However, using a VPN can lead to global bans on FiveM, putting players at risk. We are introducing a new system to solve these problems.

## 🚀 System Features

- **🌐 Modern and Server-Specific Website:**  
  All management operations will now be handled through our website. Players can top up their balance and manage complaints and support requests conveniently through the site.

- **💳 Balance Top-Up and Donation Shopping:**  
  After topping up their balance via the site, players can use the `/market` command in-game to make donation purchases. Everything is secure and seamless!

- **🛠️ Player Complaint and Support System:**  
  A forum platform will be created to manage player complaints and handle support requests.

- **📊 Server Logs:**  
  In-game server logs will be recorded on the website, allowing for detailed review.

- **⚖️ Deterrent Punishment System:**  
  With our new punishment system, roleplay errors will face stricter penalties. For instance, players who commit RDM will be sentenced to 60 minutes in jail with no chance to escape until the time expires!

## 🕵️ Punishment System Details

Each roleplay error will have specific penalties, and players will not be able to escape jail until the punishment period is over.

| ❌ Error        | 🕒 Penalty Duration |
|----------------|--------------------|
| RDM            | 60 minutes         |
| FailRP         | 45 minutes         |
| RefuseRP       | 30 minutes         |

## 🎯 Conclusion

With this system, our servers will provide a more secure and enjoyable roleplay experience for players. Donations and management will be fully handled through the site, while the enhanced punishment system will improve the quality of the game.

## ⚖️ Deterrent Punishment System (Jail)

If a player logs out, their jail time will not progress. They must stay in the game for the duration to pass and to be released. During the penalty, the player will be placed in a separate WORLD AREA and will not be able to escape.
